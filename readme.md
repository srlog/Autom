# Autom â€“ AI-Powered Workflow & Personal Assistant

Autom is a Gemini-powered agent built on **n8n** that automates workflows across multiple domains. It integrates Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, and web forms to streamline productivity tasks. In addition, Autom includes a custom local automation server that can directly control the laptop environment, enabling actions such as launching applications, browsing websites, and executing scripted sequences.

---

## Overview

Autom combines large language model reasoning with workflow automation. The system routes natural language instructions to the appropriate tools or workflows. It can:

- Automate email communication through Gmail.
- Manage scheduling and reminders with Google Calendar.
- Create and update Google Contacts programmatically.
- Respond automatically to form submissions.
- Execute desktop automation tasks through a custom Flask server.

## Workflows

### 1. Email Agent
Autom manages Gmail tasks such as sending, replying, and retrieving emails. It uses Gemini to determine intent and n8n to execute the actions.

### 2. Calendar Agent
Autom integrates with Google Calendar to create, update, and delete events. It can be used to schedule meetings or reminders automatically.

### 3. Contact Agent
This workflow manages Google Contacts by creating, updating, or retrieving contact information directly through connected APIs.

### 4. Form Response Agent
Autom can respond to submissions from external contact forms. Based on the submission, it can trigger workflows such as sending a confirmation email or scheduling a follow-up meeting.

### 5. Local Automation Server
Autom includes a Flask-based server that receives structured arrays of instructions from the agent. These are executed on the local machine using PyAutoGUI and webbrowser, enabling true desktop-level automation.
